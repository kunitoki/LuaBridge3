## Master

## Version 3.1

* Reworked the whole library to be able to use it without c++ exceptions enabled.
* Breaking Change: The method `Stack<T>::push` now takes a `std::error_code&` as last parameter and returns a `bool`.
* Breaking Change: The class `LuaException` has been reworked and it now take a `std::error_code` instead of a int.
* Breaking Change: The class `LuaException` is now thrown if a unregistered class is pushed via the Stack class, also when calling `LuaRef::operator()`, but only if exceptions are enabled.
* Breaking Change: `LuaRef::operator()` now returns the class `LuaResult`, where it is possible to obtain the call results or error message.
* Breaking Change: LuaBridge does not silently enable exceptions when calling `getGlobalNamespace`. Call `enableExceptions(lua_State*)` if you want to enable them explicitly.
* Breaking Change: Removed `RefCounterPtr`, maintaining the reference counts in a unsynchronized global table is not production quality.
* Breaking Change: Removed `Class<T>::addStaticData`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addStaticProperty`.
* Added support for specifying factory function in `Class<T>::addFactory` to do placement new of the object instance.
* Added `getNamespaceFromStack` function to construct a namespace object from a table on the stack.
* Added `std::shared_ptr` support for types intrusively deriving from `std::enable_shared_from_this`.

## Version 3.0

* Moved to C++17 as minimum supported standard C++ version.
* Fixed unaligned access in user allocated member pointers in 64bit machines reported by ASAN.
* Allow specifying a non virtual base class method when declaring class members (functions or variables) not exposed in the inherited class.
* Allow using capturing lambdas in `Namespace::addFunction` and `Class<T>::addFunction`.
* Added support for `std::byte` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::string_view` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::tuple` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::optional` as stack value type by using `LuaBridge/Optional.h`.
* Added support for `std::set` as stack value type by using `LuaBridge/Set.h`.
* Added single header amalgamated distribution file, to simplify including in projects.
* Added more asserts for functions and property names.
* Renamed `luabridge::Nil` to `luabridge::LuaNil` to allow including LuaBridge in Obj-C sources.
* Removed the limitation of maximum 8 parameters in functions.
* Removed the limitation of maximum 8 parameters in constructors.
* Removed `Class<T>::addData`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addProperty`.
* Removed `TypeList` from loki, using parameter packs and `std::tuple` with `std::apply`.
* Removed juce traces from unit tests, simplified unit tests runs.
* Bumped lua 5.2.x in unit tests from lua 5.2.0 to 5.2.4.
* Run against lua 5.3.6 and 5.4.1 in unit tests.
* Converted the manual from html to markdown.
* Small improvements to code and doxygen comments readability.

## Version 2.6

* Added namespace `addFunction()` accepting `std::function` (C++11 only).
* Added class `addStaticFunction()` accepting `std::function` (C++11 only).
* Update the Doxygen documentation.
* Add brief API reference into the manual.
* Hide non-public `luabridge` members into the `detail` namespace.
* Fix stack cleanup by `LuaRef::isInstance()` method.

## Version 2.5

* Introduce stack `isInstance()` method.
* Introduce LuaRef `isInstance()` method.
* Added a convenience `isInstance()` function template.

## Version 2.4.1

* Do not call the object destructor then its constructor throws.

## Version 2.4

* String stack get specialization doesn't change the stack value anymore.
* Added namespace `addProperty()` accepting C-functions.

## Version 2.3.1

* Fixed registration continuation issues.

## Version 2.3

* Added class `addFunction()` accepting proxy functions (C++11 only).
* Added class `addFunction()` accepting `std::function` (C++11 only).
* Added class `addProperty()` accepting functions with lua_State* parameter.
* Added class `addProperty()` accepting `std::function` (C++11 only).
* Added stack traits for `std::unordered_map` (`UnorderedMap.h`).
* Now using lightuserdata for function pointers.

## Version 2.2.2
