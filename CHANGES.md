## Master

## Version 3.0

* Moved to C++17 as minimum supported standard C++ version.
* Reworked the whole library to be able to use it without c++ exceptions enabled.
* Breaking Change: The method `Stack<T>::push` now takes a `std::error_code&` as last parameter and returns a `bool`.
* Breaking Change: The class `LuaException` has been reworked and it now take a `std::error_code` instead of a int.
* Breaking Change: The class `LuaException` is now thrown if a unregistered class is pushed via the Stack class, also when calling `LuaRef::operator()`, but only if exceptions are enabled.
* Breaking Change: `LuaRef::operator()` now returns the class `LuaResult`, where it is possible to obtain the call results or error message.
* Breaking Change: LuaBridge does not silently enable exceptions when calling `getGlobalNamespace`. Call `enableExceptions(lua_State*)` if you want to enable them explicitly.
* Breaking Change: Removed `RefCounterPtr`, maintaining the reference counts in a unsynchronized global table is not production quality.
* Breaking Change: Removed `Class<T>::addStaticData`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addStaticProperty`.
* Breaking Change: Removed `Class<T>::addCFunction`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addFunction`.
* Breaking Change: Removed `Class<T>::addStaticCFunction`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addStaticFunction`.
* Allow specifying a non virtual base class method when declaring class members (functions or variables) not exposed in the inherited class.
* Allow using capturing lambdas in `Namespace::addFunction`, `Namespace::addProperty`, `Class<T>::addFunction`, `Class<T>::addStaticFunction`, `Class<T>::addProperty` and `Class<T>::addStaticProperty`.
* Added support for specifying factory functor in `Class<T>::addConstructor` to do placement new of the object instance.
* Added `Namespace::addVariable` to allow adding a modifiable value by copy into the namespace without incurring in function calls or metatables generation.
* Added `getNamespaceFromStack` function to construct a namespace object from a table on the stack.
* Added `registerMainThread` function especially useful when using lua 5.1 to register the main lua thread.
* Added `std::shared_ptr` support for types intrusively deriving from `std::enable_shared_from_this`.
* Added `Class<T>::addFunction` overload taking a `lua_CFunction` as if it were a member.
* Added `Class<T>::addIndexMetaMethod` to allow register `__index` metamethod fallback on a registered class.
* Added `Class<T>::addNewIndexMetaMethod` to allow register `__newindex` metamethod fallback on a registered class.
* Added `LuaRef::isValid` to check when the reference is a LUA_NOREF.
* Added `LuaRef::isCallable` to check when the reference is a function or has a `__call` metamethod.
* Added `LuaException::state` to return the `lua_State` associated with the exception.
* Added support for `std::byte` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::string_view` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::tuple` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::optional` as stack value type.
* Added support for `std::set` as stack value type by using `LuaBridge/Set.h`.
* Added support to `LuaRef` for being hashed with `std::hash` (`LuaRef` properly usable in `std::unordered_map`).
* Added single header amalgamated distribution file, to simplify including in projects.
* Added more asserts for functions and property names.
* Renamed `luabridge::Nil` to `luabridge::LuaNil` to allow including LuaBridge in Obj-C sources.
* Removed the limitation of maximum 8 parameters in functions.
* Removed the limitation of maximum 8 parameters in constructors.
* Removed `Class<T>::addData`, it was just an alias for `Class<T>::addProperty`.
* Removed `TypeList` from loki, using parameter packs and `std::tuple` with `std::apply`.
* Removed juce traces from unit tests, simplified unit tests runs.
* Changed all generic functions in `LuaRef` and `TableItem` to accept arguments by const reference instead of by copy.
* Fixed issue when `LuaRef::cast<>` fails with exceptions enabled, popping from the now empty stack could trigger the panic handler twice.
* Fixed unaligned access in user allocated member pointers in 64bit machines reported by ASAN.
* Fixed access of `LuaRef` in garbage collected `lua_thread`.
* Included testing against Luau VM
* Bumped lua 5.2.x in unit tests from lua 5.2.0 to 5.2.4.
* Bumped lua 5.4.x in unit tests from lua 5.4.1 to 5.4.4.
* Run against lua 5.3.6 and 5.4.4 in unit tests.
* Run against Luau and LuaJIT in unit tests.
* Converted the manual from html to markdown.
* Small improvements to code and doxygen comments readability.
* Support for `__fastcall` function pointers.
