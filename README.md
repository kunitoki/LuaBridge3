# LuaBridge 3.0

[LuaBridge][1] is a lightweight and dependency-free library for mapping data,
functions, and classes back and forth between C++ and [Lua][2] (a powerful,
fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language). LuaBridge has been tested
and works with Lua revisions starting from 5.1.5, and also compatibility is
provided with lua 5.2.4, 5.3.6 and 5.4.1 as well as [LuaJit][3].

LuaBridge is usable from a compliant C++17 compiler and offers the following features:

- [MIT Licensed][4]
- Headers-only: No Makefile, no .cpp files, just one #include and one header file (optional) !
- Simple, light, and nothing else needed (like Boost).
- No macros, settings, or configuration scripts needed.
- Supports different object lifetime management models.
- Convenient, type-safe access to the Lua stack.
- Automatic function parameter type binding.
- Easy access to Lua objects like tables and functions.
- Interoperable with most common c++ standard library container types.
- Written in a clear and easy to debug style.

Please read the [LuaBridge Reference Manual][5] for more details on the API.

## Status

![CMake](https://github.com/kunitoki/LuaBridge3/workflows/CMake/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Unit Tests

Unit test build requires a CMake and C++17 compliant compiler.

There are 4 unit test flavors:
* `LuaBridgeTests51` - uses Lua 5.1
* `LuaBridgeTests52` - uses Lua 5.2
* `LuaBridgeTests53` - uses Lua 5.3
* `LuaBridgeTests54` - uses Lua 5.4

Generate Unix Makefiles and build on Linux:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kunitoki/LuaBridge3.git

mkdir -p LuaBridge/build
pushd LuaBridge/build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
# or cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# or cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
popd
```

Generate XCode project and build on MacOS:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kunitoki/LuaBridge3.git

mkdir -p LuaBridge/build
pushd LuaBridge/build
cmake -G Xcode ../ # Generates XCode project build/LuaBridge.xcodeproj
cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
# or cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# or cmake --build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
popd
```

Generate VS2019 solution on Windows:
```cmd
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kunitoki/LuaBridge3.git

mkdir LuaBridge/build
pushd LuaBridge/build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16" ../ # Generates MSVS solution build/LuaBridge.sln
popd
```

## Official Repository

LuaBridge is published under the terms of the [MIT License][4].

The original version of LuaBridge was written by Nathan Reed. The project has
been taken over by Vinnie Falco, who added new functionality, wrote the new
documentation, and incorporated contributions from Nigel Atkinson. Then it has
been forked from the original https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge into its
own LuaBridge3 repository, and development continued there.
